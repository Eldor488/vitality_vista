# Fitness App Design in Figma

## Steps to Design Your Fitness App in Figma

1. **Set Up Your Figma Project**
   - Create a new project in Figma.
   - Set up your artboards (frames) for desktop view, typically 1440px width is a good starting point.

2. **Design the Header**
   - **Header Layout:**
     - Create a header frame at the top of your artboard.
     - Add your app logo on the left side of the header.
     - Create navigation links (Dashboard, Food Log, Exercise Log, Progress, Recipes) aligned horizontally.

3. **Design the Sections with Color Changes**
   - **Color Palette:**
     - Choose a distinct color for each section (e.g., blue for Exercise Log, green for Food Log, etc.).
     - Create color swatches in Figma for easy reuse.

4. **Design the Sections**
   - **Dashboard:**
     - Create a section for the dashboard with basic summary stats.
   - **Food Log:**
     - Design a section for logging food items with a user-friendly interface.
     - Include search functionality and detailed nutritional information display.
   - **Exercise Log:**
     - Design a section for logging exercises with inputs for exercise type, duration, and intensity.
   - **Progress:**
     - Design a section for visualizing progress with charts.
   - **Recipes:**
     - Design a section for browsing and filtering recipes with clear nutritional info.

5. **Interactive Prototyping**
   - Use Figma’s prototyping feature to link the navigation links in the header to their respective sections.
   - Change the header color based on the active section to provide visual feedback.

## Example Design Process

1. **Create the Header:**
   - Draw a rectangle at the top of your frame for the header.
   - Add text layers for the logo and navigation links.
   - Style the text and add some padding/margin for spacing.

2. **Design the Color Change Mechanism:**
   - For each section, duplicate the header and change its background color according to the section's theme.
   - Use Figma’s components feature to create a base header component and override colors for each section.

3. **Section Designs:**
   - **Dashboard:**
     - Add widgets or cards displaying key metrics.
   - **Food Log:**
     - Add a form for entering food items.
     - Include a list or table to show logged foods with nutritional info.
   - **Exercise Log:**
     - Add a form for entering exercises.
     - Include inputs for type, duration, intensity, and calories burned.
   - **Progress:**
     - Add placeholder charts using Figma’s shape and line tools.
   - **Recipes:**
     - Add a grid layout for recipe cards.
     - Include filters for dietary preferences and health labels.

## Tips for Using Figma

- **Components:** Use components for repeating elements like headers, buttons, and input fields. This makes it easier to manage and update your design.
- **Styles:** Create text styles and color styles to maintain consistency throughout your design.
- **Prototyping:** Use the prototyping feature to link pages and create a clickable prototype that demonstrates the navigation and interaction.
- **Feedback:** Share your Figma design with stakeholders or team members to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.

## Visual Example

### Header (All Sections)

### Active Section Header Example (Exercise Log - Blue)

Each section should have its unique color and content layout to reflect the functionality and theme of that part of the app.
