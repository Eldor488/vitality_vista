# Fitness App

## Features:
- Track the foods you eat, calorie count.
- Track your physical activity.
- Being able to create graphs within the app.
- Being able to add things such as weight, and track the changes of this, like you have lost 22% within the last month.
- When tracking physical activity as question like how many did you workout for, maybe divide this and reference effort levels like it was easy, regular, hard, demanding, total oblivion.
- For the food we could connect to an API that contains food info such as calories, satiety level, protein, and other food details that may be necessary.
- This will be a web app for the start.
- I was thinking React for the frontend.
- MySQL for the backend, I was thinking either next.js, express, and then node. I still have to figure it out.
- And D3.js for the graphs. For the styling, I probably will use CSS and then sass to make it better.
- Look for a program or app to track my progress/divide the work in different stages, maybe implement a DevOps methodology.
